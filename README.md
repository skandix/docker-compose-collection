# docker-compose-collection
My collection of docker-compose files i've made and that doesn't contain any sensetive information :joy: 



Cleaning up some of the files before publishing them here :)

With each docker-compose.yml, there will follow a example.env, to use this is to fill in your own details, and then rename it
from ```example.env```` to ```.env```

````bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

# TODO
point to install guide of docker and docker-compose
add in .yml files
cleanup everything
get some sleep
make sure I don't push any pws to git, which is one hell of stupid idea.
add a quick how to use all files.
