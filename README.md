# docker-compose-collection
My collection of docker-compose files i've made and that doesn't contain any sensetive information hopefully :joy:

# Overview
* [Code](./code/README.md)
* [Games](./games/README.md)
* [Media](./media/README.md)
* [Mgmt](./mgmt/README.md)
* [Misc](./misc/README.md)

# Install
There is already great guides out there on how to install both Docker and Docker-compose :)
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
* [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose-on-linux-systems)

## How to use?!
1. Find the docker-compose.yml you want to use.
2. Copy it to a safe place ;)
3. rename ``example.env`` to ``.env``
4. edit the ``.env`` to fit your setup
5. run ``docker-compose up -d```to bring up all containers as described in docker-compose.yml
6. Profit ?!?!
